# WWDC-2021-DensitySimulator
My WWDC 2021 Swift Student Challenge - Density Simulator created using playgroundbook Author template

## How to Run?
Download the playgroundbook file and run it on MacOS or iPadOS. Make sure you have the Playgrounds app in your device.

## Technologies Used
Frameworks: UIKit, AVFoundation and PlaygroundSupport.
IDE: Xcode 12.4
Compatible on Swift Playground 3.4.1 on iPadOS 14.4.2 and MacOS 11.2.3

## My Motivation
As a student tutor that teaches math and science, I have already seen many students having a hard time in understanding physics, including, but not limited to how density works. I hope this playground can help students to learn about density in a fun and interactive way.
